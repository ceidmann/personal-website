<p align="center">Personal portfolio website is a simple and interactive website and blog that has been developed using 
Django and Bootstrap. It took me a
few weeks to complete and deploy it.</p>

## About

Personal portfolio website is aimed at demonstrating the capabilities of Django, a Python web framework which has been 
used for the backend and Bootstrap 
which has been used to design the front-end and JQuery.

## Features

Features and functionalities demonstrated in this project:

1. Responsive pages and controls (forms, buttons, navigation etc.)
2. New user registration
3. User profile management for registered users
4. User authentication
5. Handling of static files (Images, Scrpts and Cascading Style Sheets)
6. HTML styling of blog posts and attaching media content.

## ‚õèÔ∏èBuilt with

Modules, frameworks, package, dependencies etc in bullet points. Add-ons/plugins can be found in acknowledgements 
section.

- Python
- Django
- Bootstrap
- JQuery

## Getting Started

This project requires Python (version 3.8 or higher) and Git at the very minimum. See [deployment](#Deployment) for 
notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Pipenv / pip
- Django
- Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) server e.g Heroku, PythonAnywhere, Heroku etc.
- Git

### Installation

Step by step methods to guide the reader how to setup local dev environment for eg:

1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/jkariukidev/personal-website.git`
2. Install all the dependencies either using pipenv or pip. My preference is pipenv. Read more in
[this pipenv guide](https://docs.pipenv.org/).
```commandline
cd personal project
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Modify the text and images as you wish. Knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some Django template may be required.
4. Create/update the database schema (we are using default SQLite database).

```python
python manage.py migrate
```
5. Create a superuser to administer this website.
```python
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
6. Important! Generate Django secret key required for your project to run using 
[this site](https://django-secret-key-generator.netlify.app/) 
and copy it to the clipboard. The key generator appears as shown below.
7. Set the copied secret_key as shown below, where `XXXXXXXXX` represents the key.: <br>
Linux: `export SECRET_KEY="XXXXXXXXX"` <br> 
Windows Command Prompt (CMD): `set SECRET_KEY="XXXXXXXXX"` <br>
Windows Powershell: `Set-Item -Path Env:\SECRET_KEY -Value "XXXXXXXXX"`

8. Run the local development server. Note the additional settings variable pointing to the local settings configuration 
9. file.
```python
python manage.py runserver --settings=PersonalWebsite.settings.local
```
7. Open the website in the URL _https://localhost:8000_ and it should appear as shown below. 
8. To end the local server, typie Ctrl+C on your keyboard. 

## Deployment

This project is deployment-ready with few enhancements to be done. According to 
[Django deployment referecne](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/deployment/), this project can be deployed via
the [Web Server Gateway Interface](https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (WSGI) or [Asynchronous Server Gateway
Interface](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (ASGI). The WGSI is being employed in this project. 

### Heroku
TBD

[//]: # (1. To test production configuration, run the following)

[//]: # (2. Push your code to it)

[//]: # (3. Create New Project on your [Vercel Dashboard]&#40;https://vercel.com/dashboard&#41;)

[//]: # (4. Import your Git Repository)

[//]: # (5. After successful import, changes made to the Production Branch &#40;commonly "main/master"&#41; will be a Production Deployment and rest all branches will generate Preview Deployments.)

[//]: # (6. Once deployed, you will get a URL for your live app, such as: `https://xyz.vercel.app`)

### PythonAnywhere
TBD

[//]: # (1. To test production configuration, run the following)

[//]: # (2. Push your code to it)
